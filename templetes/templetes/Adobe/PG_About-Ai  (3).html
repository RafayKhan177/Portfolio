						<h3>A great tool for professional designers!</h3></span>Adobe Illustrator CC is the ideal choice for creating stunning vector graphics, drawings, and other artwork. It provides you with a wide range of tools for professional design work. For many years, Adobe has been the industry standard in several design software. Whether you need to create a banner for your startup or work as a professional web designer with a corporate, Adobe Illustrator CC will be an excellent choice. It helps boost your creativity and features an impressive set of brushes, drawing tools, gradient effects, color processing tools, special effects, and filters. With this program, you can add the final touch to your creations within seconds.</span>
						<hr>
						<h3>Plenty of features with various effects!</h3></span>Adobe Illustrator CC is one of the most popular vector graphics applications. It has been designed to create digital graphics, logos, typography, illustrations, mobile content, videos, and web designs. Since it comes packaged with Adobe’s Mercury Performance System, it can improve your workflow, provide greater speed, and handle large-sized files. With several preset templates, Illustrator CC makes it easier to create stunning visuals for marketing campaigns.					</span>
						<hr>
						<h3>Does Adobe Illustrator CC feature effects and graphics?</h3></span>Compared to AutoCAD and PaintTool SAI, Adobe Illustrator comes with various vector drawing tools, which can help you create scalable graphics. The term ‘resolution independent’ perfectly defines ‘vectors’. It means you can resize several elements in the creation without compromising on quality.

						With Illustrator CC, this property extends to the tool’s ‘effects’ section. In spite of the modified resolution, shadows, blurs, and textures, your creations are able to retain quality. Additionally, the program provides support for cross-media design. As such, the layout can adapt to different preferences, whether you edit or draw something for a mobile phone, online publishing platforms, or digital printing.
						
						Adobe Illustrator features a rich brush palette. In fact, you also get the opportunity to create new brush styles. The ‘Bristle’ and ‘Blob’ brush are two good examples. While the former gives a natural look with realistic strokes, the latter can generate a single vector shape. Some other prominent features worth mentioning include 3D effects, live distortion, the possibility to blend shapes, wide array of symbols, shape builder, Gaussian blur, and more.</span>
						<hr>
						<h3>Does Adobe Illustrator CC have an intuitive interface?</h3></span>Unlike competitors, Illustrator features an intuitive interface. Therefore, the program is easy to navigate and allows you to maximize productivity. While working in this tool, you can move around fluidly to manage different workspaces. Moreover, you can easily maintain various layout changes or reset parameters.

						The program provides you with a wide range of essential tools, which can ensure precise drawings and sketches with vector graphics. Illustrator is powered by a solid image-tracing engine, which ensures your creations are accurate and clean. While applying gradients on strokes or objects, you get complete control over placement and opacity. Without a doubt, Illustrator lets you perform various functions with ease.</span>
						<hr>
						<h3>Is Adobe Illustrator CC beginner-friendly?</h3></span>Compared to Corel Painter and Blender, Illustrator is easier to navigate. However, like most vector drawing tools, if you’re a beginner, you might find this one complicated. Fortunately, it only takes a few attempts before you get a hang of the various features and tools. It’s worth mentioning that Adobe Illustrator comes with a set of preset templates. There’s also a ‘Help’ section, which can answer your queries and doubts.

						If you want to try a few basic features in the program, you’ll find Illustrator quite easy to use. With the step-by-step tutorials, you can cover the basics as well as advanced techniques. Everything has been organized in a crystal clear manner. As such, the program welcomes you with a straightforward, intuitive interface from the beginning. Since Illustrator CC is backed by the IT giant, you can expect regular updates to improve the program. The company keeps making improvements, such as customizable toolbars, global editing, freeform gradients, trim/presentation previews, and more.</span>
						<hr>
						<h3>Does Adobe Illustrator CC support Cloud?</h3></span>Illustrator CC seamlessly integrates with Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite, which is way more powerful than competitors like Silhouette Studio. Using the latest versions of Dreamweaver and Photoshop, you can easily export and import content as well as projects. When it comes to integration, Dreamweaver is well supported, since Illustrator allows testing support and dynamic authoring for CMS like Joomla!, Drupal, and WordPress.

						With Adobe Illustrator, you can create excellent vector artwork for a wide range of occasions and projects. Due to the power, precision, and a wide range of tools, the program has a global fan following. The latest version comes with a ‘Touch Type’ tool, which provides you with more control over navigation.
						
						With Illustrator, you can work on multiple files simultaneously. The tool provides you with more freedom to enjoy creativity. Over the years, the company has improved several areas, including color, drawing, type, workspace, and painting. Moreover, once you’ve worked on the design, you can choose from multiple exporting options available in Illustrator.
						
						It won’t be wrong to say that Adobe Illustrator CC is an excellent choice for designers and artists looking for precision and accuracy in graphics. The tool encourages imagination, speed, and creativity to help you create stunning visuals. Since the program doesn’t affect system performance, you don’t have to worry about lags or crashes.</span>
						<hr>
						<h3>The industry standard for vector graphics!</h3></span>Overall, Adobe Illustrator CC is an excellent product. While it comes with a wide range of features, it doesn’t overwhelm you with a cluttered interface or lack of customization options. The latest version of the program comes with various bug fixes and support for Cloud apps. For years, Illustrator CC has been the industry standard for vector editing on Windows PCs. If Adobe continues to consider user feedback and innovations, Illustrator will remain the most popular choice for vector drawings, editing, and creating stunning visuals. Whether you’re getting started with design work or have been working as a professional, a free trial of this tool will be a smart choice.</span>
